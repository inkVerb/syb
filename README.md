# SYB Code
*The SYB Understanding of Code: "So You're Both"*

I. The "So You're Both" (hereafter SYB) Understanding of Code (also known as 'SYB Code') is a worldview perspective based on an understanding of computer and human languages.

II. By referring to the "SYB Code" in my work, I am including the fundamental ideas, implications, and applications of these concepts of the SYB Code in the remainder of my work, whether in code, writing, speech, or any cooperative effort. Therefore, it is prerequisite that this SYB Code be reviewed, understood, and agreed to as being part of said work it was referred to in.

III. Identifyability of Color: I believe the following about color...
1. Color is identifyable. I mean nothing biggotous by identifying a color by a name that helps to recognize a color nor by holding an understanding of color as explained here in this SYB Code.
2. Color is unique. In the R-G-B color spectrum, for example, red is other than blue or green.
3. Color is combinable. Color can include "SYB". For example, "cyan" (#00FFFF) is blue and green, even though blue is not green and green is not blue.
4. Color is distinct. #FF00FF cannot be #FFFF00. Retaining this distinction is necessary to preserve and enjoy the beauty of colors. This is least of all "limiting" and most of all "empowering".
5. Color is predictable. Using certain colors in various contexts and combinations of shade, hue, value, and other variable has foreseeable behaviors, results, perceptions, and personality. This predictability is part of what honors and celebrates working with color. It is part of due diligence to understand this predictability, study it, recognize it, and acknowledge it.
6. Color terminilogy has "significance": When speaking of a six color pallet, generally known terms may be used, such as red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, and yellow. This could also include orange, purple, gray, brown, and others. There are many different terms for each of these generic shades, but those technical terms are only required when using pallets so technical and those technical terms for colors can only have guaranteed understanding if referring to or providing a specific glossary for what specific color is meant by what term.
7. These beliefs about color have corresponding rendering forms in color systems other than R-G-B, including, but not limited to, CMYK.
8. Exceptions to color presumptions always exist. This is presumed to be necessary and expected.

IV. Identifyability of Geometry: I believe the following about geometry...
1. Geometry is identifyable. I mean nothing biggotous by identifying a geometric shape by a name that helps to recognize that shape nor by holding an understanding of geometry as explained here in the SYB Code.
2. Geometry is unique. In Euclidean geometry, for example, a plane is other than a point, sphere, or line.
3. Geometry is combinable. Geometry can include "SYB". For example, a plane is a point and a line, eventhough the line is not the point and the point is not the line.
4. Geometry is distinct. A cube cannot be a sphere. Retaining this distinction is necessary to preserve and enjoy the beauty of geometry. This is least of all "limiting" and most of all "empowering".
5. Geometry is predictable. Using certain geometric shapes and forms in verious contexts and combination of art, architecture, design, structure, size, and other variables has foreseeable behaviors, results, perceptions, and personality. This predictability is part of what honors and celebrates working with geometry. It is part of due diligence to understand this predictability, study it, recognize it, and acknowledge it.
6. Geometry terminology has "significance": When speaking of basic shapes, generally known terms may be used, such as circle, triangle, square, rectangle, oval, and pentagon. This could also include sphere, pyramid, cube, and others. There are many different terms for each of these generic shapes, but those technical terms are only required when using geometic systems so technichal and those technical terms for geometic shapes can only have guaranteed understanding if referring to or providing a specific glossary for what specific geometric form is meant by what term.
7. These beliefs about color have corresponding rendering forms in geometry systems other than Euclidean, including, but not limited to, non-Euclidean.
8. Exceptions to geometric presumptions always exist. This is presumed to be necessary and expected.

V. Identifyability of Language: I believe the following about language...
1. Language is identifyable. I mean nothing biggotous by identifying a language, its rules of syntax and vocabulary, and the name for a language that helps to recognize that language nor by holding an understanding of language as explained here in the SYB Code.
2. Language is unique. In a human language, for example, a noun is other than a verb, adjective, or article.
3. Language is combinable. Language can include "SYB". For example, a gerund is noun and a verb, eventhough the gerund is not the noun and the verb is not the gerund.
4. Language is distinct. English cannot be Spanish. Retaining this distinction is necessary to preserve and enjoy the beauty of language. This is least of all "limiting" and most of all "empowering".
5. Language is predictable. Using certain syntax, language, vocabulary sets, dialects, formatting, rendering, and other variables in various contexts and application situations has foreseeable behaviors, results, perception, and personality. This predictability is part of what honors and celebrates working with language. It is part of due diligence to understand this predictability, study it, recognize it, and acknowledge it.
6. Language terminology has "significance": When speaking of different languages, generally known terms may be used, such as Romance, Eastern, tribal, phonetic, pictographic, and oral. This could also include Italian, cursive, typewritten, and others. There are many different terms for each set of syntax and vocabulary, but those technical terms are only requires when using syntax and language so technical and those technical terms for syntactical systems and formatting requirements can only have guaranteed understanding if referring to or providing a specific glossary for what specific syntax compnents are meant by what terms.
7. These beliefs about language have corresponding rendering forms in language systms other than human language, including, but not limited to, computer programming languages.
8. Exceptions to syntax and vocabulary presumptions always exist. This is presumed to be necessary and expected.

VI. The "SYB Code" can be applied in principle across disciplines in their completeness without requiring modification or citation of the "SYB Code".

VII. The originator of any work may state and include the "SYB Code" by mere mention that "the SYB Code", and possibly "it's principals" apply. In doing so, the originator declares that any applicable precedents are expected to be understood by diligent and thus credible reviewers and the meaning will remain binding, even if it needs to be reiterated as such at a later time resulting from any cause of incompleteness on behalf of a reviewer. And, this stement to include the "SYB Code" may be done openly and without permission since the "SYB Code" is 100% public domain.
